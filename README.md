# Project: Simple Linear Regression on COVID-19 Dataset

# Objective
The objective of this project is to implement a simple linear regression model using the COVID-19 dataset. The goal is to predict a continuous target variable (e.g., COVID-19 cases) based on one or more predictor variables (e.g., population). This analysis aims to evaluate the model's performance, make predictions, and visualize the results to assess the model's accuracy.

# Key Activities
Data Preparation: Select relevant features and clean the dataset to ensure it is free from inconsistencies, missing values, or duplicates.

Model Training: Train a simple linear regression model on the cleaned data to predict COVID-19 cases based on population data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to understand its accuracy and predictive power.

Prediction and Visualization: Make predictions on the test dataset and visualize the regression line, as well as actual vs. predicted values, to assess the model's performance.

# Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for data analysis and modeling.

Pandas: Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and preparation.

NumPy: Employed for numerical operations and array manipulations.

scikit-learn: Utilized for implementing machine learning algorithms, particularly linear regression, and for model evaluation.

Matplotlib: Used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations to display the regression results and comparisons.

Seaborn: Utilized for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics to aid in data visualization.
