Project: Simple Linear Regression on COVID-19 Dataset

Objective
The objective of this project is to implement a simple linear regression model using the COVID-19 dataset. The goal is to predict a continuous target variable (e.g., COVID-19 cases) based on one or more predictor variables (e.g., population). This analysis aims to evaluate the model's performance, make predictions, and visualize the results to assess the model's accuracy.

Key Activities
Data Preparation: Select relevant features and clean the dataset to ensure it is free from inconsistencies, missing values, or duplicates.

Model Training: Train a simple linear regression model on the cleaned data to predict COVID-19 cases based on population data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to understand its accuracy and predictive power.

Prediction and Visualization: Make predictions on the test dataset and visualize the regression line, as well as actual vs. predicted values, to assess the model's performance.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for data analysis and modeling.

Pandas: Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and preparation.

NumPy: Employed for numerical operations and array manipulations.

scikit-learn: Utilized for implementing machine learning algorithms, particularly linear regression, and for model evaluation.

Matplotlib: Used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations to display the regression results and comparisons.

Seaborn: Utilized for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics to aid in data visualization.
